                Hello! My name is Felicia Sunanto and I was born and raised right here in Tucson, AZ where everything
                wants to poke or sting you. I really love
                animals, plants, and nature so I decided to attend the University of Arizona and received a bachelor's
                degree
                in
                natural resources with a focus on wildlife management and
                conservation (wordy I know). I currently work for the USDA Forest Service as a wild-land firefighter
                but
                I am
                sort of a trick of all trades. I also work for developed recreation and maintain all of
                the picnic sites, campgrounds, and disperse campgrounds. Familiar places you may know of are Mount
                Lemmon,
                Sabino Canyon,
                and Redington Pass. Lastly, I have done work in rangeland management and invasive species removal
                which
                involved a lot of back-country hiking and
                off-roading in secluded areas to collect vegetative field data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from that passion, I really love everything about the video game and technology industry. I am an
                avid
                gamer and that's probably what you'll find me doing on my free time. One of my favorite gigs
                was working as a social media representative for a video card company called "XFX". My duty was to
                literally
                talk about
                anything related to video games every day and it was awesome! Which brings me here, as to why I am
                attending
                the
                program! I still have that strong "itch" to see if I could make a career path into the industry.
            </p>

                What's this? Still reading? Okay! I have a precious black cat with
                yellow golden eyes,
                her name is Okami (yes, named after the video game), and she loves to play fetch..."yaaaaas". My
                favorite anime
                film director is Hayao Miazaki/Studio Ghibli. No one can beat me at Mariokart 64. I built my own PC,
                there is
                just so much satisfaction doing it yourself! I enjoy painting and baking treats. I have a bracelet that
                is
                permanently stuck on my wrist since elementary school. That is all.
