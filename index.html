            Hello! I was born and raised right here in Tucson, AZ where everything
            wants to poke or sting you. I really love
            animals, plants, and nature so I decided to attend the University of Arizona and received a bachelor's
            degree
            in
            natural resources with a focus on wildlife management and
            conservation (wordy I know).
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from that passion, I love video games and the technology industry. Which
            brings me here, as to why I am
            attending
            the
            program! I still have that strong "itch" to see if I could make a career path into it.
        </p>
        <p>
            What's this? Still reading? Okay! I have a precious black cat with
            yellow golden eyes,
            her name is Okami (yes, named after the video game), and she loves to play fetch..."yaaaaas". My
            favorite anime
            film director is Hayao Miazaki/Studio Ghibli. No one can beat me at Mariokart 64. I built my own PC,
            there is
            just so much satisfaction doing it yourself! I enjoy painting and baking treats. I have a bracelet that
            is
            permanently stuck on my wrist since elementary school. That is all.
